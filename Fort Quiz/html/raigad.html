              <p>Raigad is a hill fort in the Raigad district that is about 25 kilometers from Mahad. In 1674 AD, Chhatrapati Shivaji made this fort his capital and renovated it. Raigad Fort offers a ropeway that makes it possible to reach the fort from the ground in a matter of minutes.

                The stronghold additionally neglects a counterfeit lake known as the ‘Ganga Sagar Lake’. The “Maha Darwaja,” or “Huge Door,” is the only main entrance to the fort. The Nagarkhana Darwaja is a replica of the original throne in the King’s durbar of the Raigad Fort. It faces the main doorway. The acoustical design of this enclosure had been made to make it easier to hear from the doorway to the throne. The post has a renowned stronghold called “Hirakani Buruj” (Hirkani Stronghold) developed over an immense steep precipice.</p>

              <p>Mahad, in the Raigad District of Maharashtra, is home to the impressive and well-known Raigad Fort, which was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It is refer to as the “Gibraltar of the East” all over the world because it is one of the strongest fortresses ever built on the Deccan Plateau. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the architect behind a number of Raigad structures and other constructions. After being crown king of the entire Maratha Kingdom and, later, the Maratha Empire, which encompass a significant portion of the central and western regions of India, he establish this as his capital in 1674. The British East India Company launch an armed campaign in 1765 from the fort. The fort was loot and destroy by British forces on May 9, 1818.</p>

              <p>The Raigad Fort, one of India’s stunning landmarks and a site of historic events and tales of legendary warriors, cannot be accurately valued. The stunning Sahyadri mountain range stands in the background as it rises 2,700 feet (820 meters) above sea level. The Mena Darwaja, Palkhi Darwaja, Nagarkhana Darwaja, and Maha Darwaja gateways at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s Raigad Fort add to the fort’s enchantment and provide a glimpse into how people used to access it in the past. Even though it had great grounds in the past, the Raigad fort still attracts a large number of tourists and locals for picnics, trekking, and other outdoor activities.</p>

              <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took the Raigad Fort, which was formerly known as the Fort of Rairi, from Chandraraoji More, the King of Jawali, in 1656. After Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took control of the fort, he made it much bigger and gave it the name “King’s Fort” or “Raigad.” Later, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj made it the Maratha Empire’s capital. At the base of the fort, the Raigadwadi and Pachad villages are hidden away. During the Maratha rule at the Raigad Fort, these villages played a crucial role. The move till the highest point of the post begins right from Pachad itself. A 10,000-strong cavalry division was always on guard at the Pachad village during Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s reign. Additionally, approximately two miles away from Raigad, Shivaji constructed the Lingana Fort. It was utilized to house inmates.</p>

              <p>Raigad Fort was build by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.The chief architect and engineer was none other than Hiroji Indulkar.The main fort palace has the queen’s quarters, private restrooms and six chambers in all.There are ruins of a market, which was access by horseback riders once.The King’s Darbar still contains a replica of the original throne, which faces the ‘Nagarkhana Darwaja’ or main doorway in Raigad. This enclosure was acoustically tailor to help hearing right from the doorway till the throne itself.
                ‘Takmak Tok’ is the execution point and cliff from where prisoners were thrown to die in. The area is fence-off today.A statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj stands before the ruins at the main market in Raigad. The market goes up to ‘Jagdishwar Mandir’ and his samadhi along with the samadhi of Waghya, his loyal dog in. The Pachad village has the samadhi of Shivaji’s mother, Jijabai ji.</p>
